A Bash script is a text file containing a series of commands that can be executed by the Bash shell. Here's a brief explanation of Bash scripts and how to create one:

Purpose of Bash scripts:

Automate repetitive tasks
Combine multiple commands into a single script
Create custom commands or utilities
Perform system administration tasks


How to create a Bash script:
a. Open a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, or gedit)
b. Start the file with a shebang: #!/bin/bash
c. Write your commands, one per line
d. Save the file with a .sh extension (e.g., myscript.sh)
e. Make the script executable: chmod +x myscript.sh
f. Run the script: ./myscript.sh
Basic components of a Bash script:

Comments (start with #)
Variables
Control structures (if, for, while)
Functions
Command substitution



Here's a simple example of a Bash script:


#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"

# Using a variable
name="Alice"
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Using a loop
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Count: $i"
done
