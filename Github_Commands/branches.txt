A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches enable collaboration and experimentation.\n\n The `git pull` command is used to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your current branch. You would use it when you want to update your local repository with changes made by others.
