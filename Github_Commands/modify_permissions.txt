To modify the permissions of a file so that only the owner can read and write to it, while the group and others can only read, use the following command:

Chmod 644 file name 

Replace `filename` with the actual name of your file. The permissions are represented as follows: 
- `6` (owner): read (4) + write (2) = 6 
- `4` (group): read (4) = 4 
- `4` (others): read (4) = 4
