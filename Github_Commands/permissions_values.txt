In Linux, file permissions are represented using numeric values as follows: 

- Read (r): 4 
- Write (w): 2 
- Execute (x): 1 

These values are combined to represent different permission sets. For example: 
- Read and Write (rw-): 4 + 2 = 6 
- Read and Execute (r-x): 4 + 1 = 5 
- Write and Execute (wx): 2 + 1 = 3 
- Read, Write, and Execute (rwx): 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
